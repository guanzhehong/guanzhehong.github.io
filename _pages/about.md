I am a researcher in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I obtained my BASc in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Toronto, and PhD at Purdue University, supervised by Dr. Stanley H. Chan.

I am interested in both the theoretical and applied sides of deep learning. My research interests primarily revolve around developing a **mechanistic** understanding of deep neural networks, towards the goal of improving the **generalization** and **interpretability** of these models. 

In particular, my recent efforts have been focused on studying **how large language models (LLMs) [reason](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04105), and [disentangle and compose concepts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16975)**. We discover intriguingly human-interpretable circuits in LLMs for solving simple propositional logic problems, and concept-composition mechanisms in LLMs for solving multi-hop in-context learning puzzles. The modularity of reasoning processes, and the ability to disentangle and compose concepts in LLMs point to the possibilities of _monitoring_ and _steering_ the LLMs' reasoning actions in the future.

I have also developed _mathematical_ theories which connect _generalization_ performance of DNNs with their **feature-learning** process, in the settings of [transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23129), and [feature-based distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07600).
